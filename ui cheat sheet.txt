UI cheat sheet
--------------

 Shared properties:

  name      - entity name, used to reference this entity

  position  - position, eg: { x, y }

  size      - entity size, eg: { width, height }

  rotation  - orientation, eg: { pitch (rotate about x), yaw (rotate about y), roll (rotate about z) }

  scale     - entity scale, affects the entity size, and also scales all children accordingly

  colour    - entity colour, also multiplied into children

  enabled   - enable state, usually gadgets will be greyed out while disabled

  visible   - entity visiblity, hiding will also hide all children

  anchor    - anchor position relative to the entity: anchor = [anchor point]
                where [anchor point] is one of:
                   topleft      topcenter       topright
                   centerleft     center     centerright
                   bottomLeft  bottomcenter  bottomright

 Shared events:
  init()              : triggered only once when the entity is loaded
  onfocus()           : triggered when an entity gains focus
  onfocuslost()       : triggered when an entity loses focus
  onenable()          : triggered when an entity is enabled
  ondisable()         : triggered when an entity is disabled
  ondown(button, pos) : triggered when a finger is placed or a mouse button is pressed down
  onup(button, pos)   : triggered when a finger is lifted or a mouse button is raised
  ontap(button, pos)  : triggered when a finger or mouse button is pressed and then lifted without being moved

 Shared actions:
  setfocus()           - set the current focus to 'this' entity
  move(target, time)   - move an entity from one location to another
  fade(target, time)   - fade from one colour to another
  spin(target, time)   - spin from one orientation to another
  resize(target, time) - scale from one size to another

    in each of the above, motion starts from the entities current position, and 'time' is optional.
      if 'time' is provided:
        'time' is the number of seconds taken to reach 'target', and 'target' is an absolute destination
      if 'time' is not provided:
        'target' is relative, expressed in units-per-second, and is endlessly accumulated
